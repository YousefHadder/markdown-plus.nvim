# Changelog

All notable changes to markdown-plus.nvim will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Format toggling**: Fixed visual line mode (`V`) formatting to apply to entire selected lines instead of just the word at cursor position
  - When using `V` to select entire lines, formatting now correctly wraps the full line content
  - Properly detects line-wise visual mode and adjusts column positions to span from start to end of lines
  - Works with all formatting types: bold, italic, strikethrough, code, and clear formatting

  - Nested lists now correctly restart numbering when returning to parent level (e.g., `1. A → 1. B, 2. C → 2. D → 1. E, 2. F` instead of `3. E, 4. F`)
  - Blank lines now properly separate lists into distinct groups that restart numbering
  - Applies to all ordered list types: numbered (`1.`, `2.`), letter-based (`a.`, `A.`), and parenthesized variants (`1)`, `a)`)
  - Works at any nesting depth

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-25

### Added
- **Quotes Management**: Added support for toggling blockquotes in markdown

  - Toggle blockquote on selected lines in visual mode with `<leader>mq`
  - `<Plug>` mapping: `<Plug>(MarkdownPlusToggleQuote)` for custom keymap configuration
  - Smart handling of existing blockquotes

- **Additional list types support**:
  - Letter-based lists: `a.`, `b.`, `c.`, ... `z.` (lowercase)
  - Letter-based lists: `A.`, `B.`, `C.`, ... `Z.` (uppercase)
  - Parenthesized ordered lists: `1)`, `2)`, `3)`
  - Parenthesized letter lists: `a)`, `b)`, `c)` and `A)`, `B)`, `C)`
  - All new list types support auto-continuation, indentation, renumbering, and checkboxes
  - Single-letter support with wraparound (z→a, Z→A)

### Changed
- **List module refactoring**:
  - Pattern-driven architecture with `PATTERN_CONFIG` table
  - Extracted helper functions: `get_next_marker()`, `get_previous_marker()`, `extract_list_content()`
  - Reduced code size from 878 to 763 lines (13% reduction)
  - Simplified `parse_list_line()` from ~170 lines to ~30 lines
  - Added module-level constants for delimiters

### Fixed
- Invalid pattern capture error when indenting parenthesized lists
- Tab/Shift-Tab now work correctly with all list types including parenthesized variants
- 'O' command (insert above) now correctly calculates markers for letter-based lists

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-25

### Fixed
- **Visual mode selection issue**: Fixed error when formatting text on first visual selection
  - Implemented workaround for Neovim's visual mode marks (`'<` and `'>`) not updating until after exiting visual mode
  - Now uses `vim.fn.getpos('v')` and `vim.fn.getpos('.')` when in active visual mode
  - Falls back to marks when called after visual mode for compatibility
  - Added position normalization to handle backward selections (right-to-left, bottom-to-top)
  - Added visual selection restoration with `gv` to keep selection active after formatting
  - Added range validation to prevent API crashes with helpful error messages
  - Formatting now works correctly on the first selection without needing to reselect text
  - Expanded test coverage with 4 new visual mode selection tests (27 format tests total)
